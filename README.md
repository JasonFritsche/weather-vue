# weather-vue

## About
Welcome to the weather-vue repository. This project serves as a sandbox for me to learn Vue. With this application you are able to retrieve the current and a five-day forecast for a given U.S. city. You can view the project live [here](https://jasonfritsche.github.io/weather-vue/).

### Project Purpose
My goals for this project were/are:
* Setup and use Vuex
* Use the Vue Router
* Use Vuetify
* Use Axios to retrieve data
* Deploy to GitHub pages
* Write unit tests with Jest
